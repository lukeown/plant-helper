# plant-helper
## Planter is a website to help people find simple plant care guides for plants that are easy to grow and take care of.
Primarily, Planter has been a way for me to learn the basics of front end web development, using languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Some Javascript features that I have implemented into this project are:
  * Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents on your page
  * Create at least 3 variables, set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page
  * Create one or more JavaScript objects (such as with multiple values contained in { }’s), modify at least one value of that object, and display it on your site
  * Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction


### Some CSS features that I have implemented into this project are:
  * A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item
